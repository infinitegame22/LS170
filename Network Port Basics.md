The correct statements in relation to network ports are:

- A port is an identifier for a specific process or application running on a host.
- Ports are used in the process of multiplexing and demultiplexing.
- Source and destination port numbers are listed in Transport layer PDUs.

The other statements are incorrect:

- A port number is associated with a specific process or application, not a particular device or host. Multiple processes or applications on a single device can use different port numbers simultaneously.
- A port number is not part of an IP address. IP addresses and port numbers are separate entities used together to establish network connections.
