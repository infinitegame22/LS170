4. What is the WEB (World Wide Web)?
	- The Web, short for World Wide Web, is a system of interconnected documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks and URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). It is a vast network of information and services that can be accessed through the Internet.

The Web was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 and has since revolutionized the way people communicate, share information, and conduct various activities online. It allows users to navigate between different websites by clicking on hyperlinks, which are text or images that provide links to other web pages or resources.

The Web operates on a client-server model, where users access web pages and resources through web browsers (such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) that act as the client. The server hosts the web pages and responds to requests from the client by sending back the requested information.

The Web encompasses a wide range of content, including text, images, videos, audio, and interactive elements. It supports various technologies, such as HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for structuring web pages, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity.

Through the Web, users can engage in activities like browsing websites, searching for information using search engines, accessing online services, shopping, social networking, and much more. It has become an integral part of everyday life for billions of people around the world, connecting individuals, businesses, organizations, and governments across the globe.
