Which of the following statements describes the function of multiplexing and demultiplexing at the Transport layer of the Internet network?

At the Transport layer of the Internet network, multiplexing and demultiplexing play crucial roles in the transmission and reception of data. Here are the statements that describe their functions:

1. Multiplexing: Multiplexing is the process of combining multiple data streams or signals into a single, composite stream for transmission over a network. At the Transport layer, multiplexing takes place by assigning unique identifiers, known as port numbers, to different data streams originating from various applications or services running on the source device. By multiplexing these streams, the Transport layer can transmit them over a single network connection or link efficiently.
    
2. Demultiplexing: Demultiplexing is the reverse process of multiplexing. It involves extracting and separating individual data streams from a composite stream at the receiving end. Demultiplexing at the Transport layer uses the port numbers present in the incoming packets to determine which data streams they belong to and directs them to the appropriate receiving applications or services. By demultiplexing the incoming data, the Transport layer ensures that each application or service receives its intended data stream correctly.
    

In summary, multiplexing combines multiple data streams into a single stream for transmission, while demultiplexing separates the individual data streams from the received composite stream and delivers them to the appropriate applications or services. These processes enable efficient and reliable communication between multiple applications over a network connection.
